## __What does it do?__
- Detect emotion from a given picture.
- Detects emotions such as anger, sadness, happiness, disgust, contempt, fear, surprise. 
- Gives suggestions such as Music, Videos and News that could help soothe the user's mood.

## __How we built it__
- We built using the Android Studio taking help of multiple open source APIs from Youtube Data, Spotify, Google News, and Washington Post. 
- After the integration of these APIs into the face detection API we were successfully able to detect emotions from a picture and then link  the responses of these APIs in a meaningful way.
